		<h3>Coffee</h3>
		<p>Coffee is a drink prepared from roasted coffee beans. Darkly colored, bitter, and slightly acidic, coffee has a stimulating effect on humans, primarily due to its caffeine content. It is the most popular hot drink in the world. Seeds of the Coffea plant's fruits are separated to produce unroasted green coffee beans.</p>

		<p>Here is a quote from Wikipedia</p>
		<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iced_coffee">Iced coffee is a coffee beverage served cold. It may be prepared either by brewing coffee normally (i.e. carafe, French press, etc.) and then serving it over ice or in cold milk, or by brewing the coffee cold. In hot brewing, sweeteners and flavoring may be added before cooling, as they dissolve faster. Iced coffee can also be sweetened with pre-dissolved sugar in water.</blockquote>
